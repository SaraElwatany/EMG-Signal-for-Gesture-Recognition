steps for running the code
1) install all needed packages
pandas 
numpy 
os
scipy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn

2) There is a notebook for every step that you need to run in the following order:

a- app.ipynb: where it iterates over each txt file in that directory & convert to csv file, then
 Merge all csv files to one csv file & save in (csv files/merged_files.csv) file 

b- preprocessing.ipynb :( applies some filters on the raw data) *** this file reduces the accuracy so we chose to ignore it while training our model***

c- features.ipynb  : feature extraction and selection 

d-models.ipynb : splitting the data, training and testing of the model, then evaluating each model.
